# üéØ **Mission Statement & Strategic Framework**

## **Ultimate Goal:**

This is a well structured six month roadmap with monthly  and weekly practice-participate contests with reading specific topics resources to transform from current level (1400 CF rating) to Orange (2100+) on codeforces while building championship-level team skills for ICPC World Finals qualification and IUPC Bangladesh victory. This roadmap integrates systematic skill development, strategic contest participation, and proven team training methodologies.  
The roadmap combines targeted topic blocks (cp‚Äëalgorithms/CSES/EDPC), clean statement practice on AtCoder, and high‚Äëfrequency Codeforces contests with disciplined upsolving and weekly ICPC‚Äëstyle team simulations.

## **Core resources to ‚Äúuse and keep open‚Äù:** 

cp‚Äëalgorithms  :  theory

AtCoder Problems : difficulty/topic filters

AtCoder EDPC (DP) : Explore all different types of DP

CSES \+ Handbook : breadth

Codeforces EDU : data structures/techniques 

KACTL : team notebook.

## **Platform Integration Strategy:**

* **AtCoder**: *Clean fundamentals*, systematic progression (ABC/ARC weekly)

* **Codeforces**: *Primary rating platform*, speed development (3+ contests/week)

* **CSES**: *Structured topic mastery* with systematic problem coverage

* **ICPC Gym**: Team training and contest simulation environments

## **Success Timeline and targets: 1400 ‚Üí 1600(Months 1-2) ‚Üí 1850+ (Months 3-4) ‚Üí 2100+ (Months 5-6)**

* **Months 1-2:** 1400 ‚Üí 1600+ (Advanced ***Foundation***)  
* **Months 3-4:** 1600 ‚Üí 1850+ (intermediate ***Mastery*** : Expert Mastery)  
* **Months 5-6:** 1850 ‚Üí 2100+ (Orange ***Achievement***)

## **‚è±Ô∏è Contest Time Management Standards**

### **Codeforces Div. 2 (120 minutes):**

| Problem | Month 1-2 Target | Month 3-4 Target | Month 5-6 Target | Hard Cutoff | Penalty Management |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A** | **5-8 min** | **3-5 min** | **2-3 min** | **10 min** | **Max 1 wrong submission** |
| **B** | **8-15 min** | **5-10 min** | **3-7 min** | **18 min** | **Max 1 wrong submission** |
| **C** | **15-25 min** | **10-18 min** | **7-15 min** | **30 min** | **Max 2 wrong submissions** |
| **D** | **25-35 min** | **18-28 min** | **12-22 min** | **40 min** | **Max 2 wrong submissions** |
| **E** | **Study/Attempt** | **20-35 min** | **15-30 min** | **45 min** | **Focus on accuracy** |

### **AtCoder ABC (100 minutes)**

| Problem | Month 1-2 Target | Month 3-4 Target | Month 5-6 Target | Hard Cutoff | Success Rate Target |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **A** | **3-5 min** | **2-3 min** | **1-2 min** | **6 min** | **100%** |
